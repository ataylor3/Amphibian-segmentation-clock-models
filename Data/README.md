## Nuclear export simulation results and statistics

__nuclear export simulations.xlsx__

Excel book that includes raw data of first exit times (in steps or seconds) for particles simulated in sphere of corresponding nuclear radii ranging from 0.5 to 13 µm with intervals of 0.5 µm. First exit time (step, seconds) for particles is given for 10,000 iterations for each nuclear radius size. Different sheets correspond to different model types: FPT_BM_origin gives the raw data for Brownian Motion simulations for which particles start at the origin; FPT_fBM_origin gives the raw data for fractional Brownian Motion simulations for which particles start at the origin; FPT_BM_uniformDist gives the raw data for Brownian Motion simulations for which initial particle position is drawn from a uniform distribution; FPT_fBM_uniformDist gives the raw data for fractional Brownian Motion simulations for which initial particle position is drawn from a uniform distribution. Each model data sheet is followed by a correpsonding statistics sheet for which raw data has been converted into mean exit/export time (minutes), standard deviation (minutes), and the coefficient of variation for each radius size: BM_origin_statistics, fBM_origin_statistics, BM_uniformDist_statistics, and fBM_uniformDist_statistics.
